# Controling The Weather

## The Weather Service

In thie exercise, you will create a weather control service. This service's API will allow getting weather at any given place and time. But, and this is much cooler - it allows controling the weather, wherever you want!

#### Required solution:

* Create a basic service. We recommend using [express-generator](https://github.com/expressjs/generator) for bootstrapping.
* The service should have the following functionality:
  * Get the weather for any given location and time.
  * Get the weather for any given location, _now_.
  * Update the weather for a location.
  * Get the X top hottest locations right now, given a number X.
* You decide how "weather" structure looks like, and what it contains. The same for "time".
* You can use any fake data you want. _No real weather is needed._ For example, you can create a list of locations and their weather, as you see fit.

#### After you finish:

* Upload your code to `Github`, and share it with us. Notice: make it *__private__*, not public.
* Make sure the app is ready to run by running `npm i` and `npm start`.
* Make sure the API is well documented with `README` file, so we can understand it.
* *__Bonus:__* Deploy your solution to a static web hosting service of your choice (such as: `Heroku`, `Github`, `AWS S3`, `Netlify` etc..) so it is publicly available.

#### Guidelines:

* Pay attention to software design and clean code (We are believers of the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) design principals). 
* The service's interface should be [RESTful](https://restfulapi.net/). A great example for a RESTful API is [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide.html).
* We also care about things like readability, maintainability, naming, and in general everything that makes the code easy to understand and extend. **Think about the app as it should be ready to be shipped to production.**
* You are free to add any libraries of your desire.

Don't hesitate to contact us with any question.

**Good Luck!**
